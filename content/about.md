This is the website related to the R package [`textmineR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textmineR/index.html). `textmineR` is a framework for text mining in R. It attempts to find consistent workflows for common text analyses, especially topic modeling and text embeddings. `textmineR` contains many utilities for topic models and text embeddings.

`textmineR` was created with three principles in mind:

1. Maximize interoperability within R's ecosystem
2. Scaleable in terms of object storeage and computation time
3. Syntax that is idiomatic to R

The development version of `textmineR` is [here](https://github.com/TommyJones/textmineR/). You can report bugs or submit feature requests [here](https://github.com/TommyJones/textmineR/issues).
